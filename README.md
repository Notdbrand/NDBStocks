# NDBStocks
The source code for my tweak that redirects Stocks app requests to a server of your choice. 

This project was only tested on ios 6.0.1 but could work up to 6.1.6

This was design to redirect the normal Stocks app requests to my server Notdbrand.com:8000

To use this for yourself all your need to do is swap out my server url and port and insert your own. Then all you need do to is make the package using theos.

The server you could use for the stock information is YQL-X-Server.
